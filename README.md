This repository contains my completed version of the project built during the **Complete Intro to React, v9** course on Frontend Masters.

## About This Project

This is a personal project I built while following the **Complete Intro to React, v9** course by Brian Holt.  
It walks through modern React concepts, including hooks, routing, state management, and deployment.

Each folder in the original course repo represents a snapshot of the app at different stages of development.  
In my version, I’ve applied the concepts from the course and may have made a few personal modifications or improvements along the way.
